# phoneticalmatch
A program that matches phonetically equivalent words from the STDIN and a text file.

## Installation
I understand that you are using Linux or Mac and you have installed on your machine these programs:

* GIT
* Java Environment
* Maven

So first of all clone this repository to your computer:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lassounski/phoneticalmatch.git
```
Next, access the folder and issue a Maven command to build the project:
```
$ cd foneticalmatch
$ mvn install
```
Last but not least, execute the program with Java (beware of the version number that needs to be filled correctly):
```
$ java -jar target/phoneticalmatch-[VERSION_NUMBER].jar
```
